## Most Significant Bit (MSB) and Least Significant Bit (LSB)

**Most Significant Bit (MSB):**
- The bit in a binary number with the highest value, located on the left.
- Contributes the most to the number’s value.

**Least Significant Bit (LSB):**
- The bit in a binary number with the lowest value, located on the right.
- Contributes the least to the number’s value.

### Example

Below is an illustration of an 32-bit binary number:

In this example:
- **MSB** (Most Significant Bit) is the leftmost bit.
- **LSB** (Least Significant Bit) is the rightmost bit.
